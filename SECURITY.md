# Security

This repository contains documentation and schemas.

If you found an issue in the CSP itself (missing control, unclear guidance),
open a public issue with rationale and suggested wording.

If you found a security issue in a downstream implementation that uses the CSP,
report it privately to that implementation’s maintainers.
